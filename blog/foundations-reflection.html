  <h3 class="plan-questions">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
  
   <p id="q1">
     1. That my journey into growth mindset is still just beginning and although I have put some time and work into it, I still have more learning to do.<br><br>
     2. One of my limitations is my fear of failure which results in perfectionism. I think that coding is a really great way for me to tackle this head-on and to become more comfortable with the uncomfortable.<br><br>
     3. That I am a positive and resilient person that loves to learn and explore the unknown when I’ve been able to push past my initial anxiety.

   <h3 class="plan-questions">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

    <p id="q2">
      Programming and learning require a high level of patience, resilience, frustration tolerance, flexibility and dedication, these are all values that take practice and that are very difficult at any age. Learning anything new is challenging, it can make you feel self-conscious, and doubtful of your own ability, negative self-talk can easily lead a student off their path and can provoke stress and emotional difficulty in an already challenging situation. <br><br>

      Self-compassion and self-awareness helps us understand our strengths as well as our limitations so we plan ahead and avoid getting caught up in negative self-talk. <br><br>
  
      Personally, I know that I get nervous before commencing a new task, I fear failure and this can put me off the work. Being aware of this procrastination tendency means that I need to have a strict schedule and that I would benefit from reframing the need procrastinate. Now I am trying my best to keep to schedule and begin a task as soon as I am able to. This gives me the opportunity to revise, and edit my work. Instead of rush and stress through it.

   <h3 class="plan-questions">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3> 
    
    <p>
      I am surprised by how comfortable I feel in the core learning content. Having come from a pedagogy background these soft skills have been a big part of my education for the last few years. <br><br>

      Looking retrospectively, I am also very proud of the progress I have made in my mental health over the last year. I have been able to implement small and consistent activities and routines into my life that have allowed me to grow into a more self-aware and peaceful person.

  <h3 class="plan-questions">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The most challenging aspects of the the core learning was confronting some of my unconscious biases and realising the set ideas I have around my abilities and my skills.

  <h3 class="plan-questions">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

    <p>
      I think that DevAcademy focuses heavily on core learning during foundation as a preparation for the challenge to come in bootcamp. Learning to code definitely pushes students to their limits and I think having a stronger sense of self and compassion can make the journey more positive and enjoyable. <br><br>

      There is a stereotype of intellectual people being more disconnected to their social and emotional sides of their well-being. Although this is not the case for everyone, dedicating a lot of time to one skill can limit the time we use to develop the other skills of our hauora. having a focus on core learning reminds students that we are complex beings who’s wellbeing is not simply intellectual, but physical, emotional, mental and spiritual as well.

  <h3 class="plan-questions">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      I really value looking inwards to assess my values and identity. I feel empowered when I learn the core content and it gives me the encouragement that I need for the tech portion of the curriculum which really pushes me to my limits.
