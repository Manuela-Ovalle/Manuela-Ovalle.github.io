      <p>
         The role of a developer is to write code that solves a problem. Problems like slow management systems, communication difficulties, outdated software etc, the list goes on. Just like a journalist needs to edit their wrtiting and get their facts right, a developer needs to check that their code runs to plan and that it is bug free.

            Here are some methods to ease the problem solving methods. This list was taken from the DevAcademy curriculum website.

        <h2 class="plan-questions">Personal Experiences</h2>

    <p>
      This week we had to work on Javascript katas, which are a range of exercises using our new javascript knowledge. One of the exercises was to create a gradebook that would display grades belonging to list of made up students. I tried my best to plan out the steps in plain english and to visualise what the process would look like. Due my lack of early place in my javascript journey, I struggled to figure out how to make this code work. I tried on my own for several hours using online resources that I could find. <br>

      Next I followed a video tutorial made by one of our tutors. I was beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. However, by the end of the video, my code did not run. The main feeling I had was confusion. After trying for another few hours to solve the issue. I decided to take a break from the code and have a rest. It was the evening. This exercise that was suppose to take 4 hours according to the instructions page, but it had taken about 7. The next morning, I had a catch up with my tutor and he was able to look through my code and fix it up for my. Funnily enough, it was a small syntax error. Syntax is like coding grammar, I had put curly brackets in the wrong place! hah! <br> <br>

      I learnt that it is important to take a step back when you are tired. I have been getting to points where I am not able to focus and although i may read an article a few times, I am not retaining the information due to being tired. I want to be able to use my time more efficiently and work smarter, I know that I need to have patience and that it will come with time. <br>

      I’ve also been working on the FreeCodeCamp javascript curriculum to supplement my learning at DevAcademy. There have been moments where I can’t answer a question correctly despite knowing the information. In these moments the best problem solving technique for me is to slow my breathing, relax, re-read the question and go through the answer slowly. I get anxious when I am working on my code, I often feel a great sense of urgency to get through a problem, and this makes me skim read and miss details. It’s a great reminder to accept the learning journey and recognise that often a problem will take longer if we rush through it.<br>

      I want to continue to practice this mindful learning. I also think that reframing the word problem into the word challenge may be a more productive and motivating way forward for myself. <br>

      I feel a great sense of reward and pride in tech, although I am still beginning to crawl, I am very much looking forward to the moment when I have more of an understanding of JS so I can dig around in my knowledge to find solutions before asking for help.

            <div id="spacer"></div>
      

      <h3 class ="plan-questions">Pseudocode</h3>

        <p id="pseudocode">
          Pseudocode is text that a developer includes in the code files however this text it's self is written in plain english and commeneted out. we can use this text to have a written plan for our code. Personally I like to write the steps I plan on working through to write my code. This pseudocode is also  a great way to explain our code to other devs that we may be collaborating with. 
       </p>
       <h3>Pseudocode guidelines</h3>
       <p>
        1. Keep it simple: <br> This text should be easy to read, straight to the point and consice.<br><br>
        2. Our pseudocode is VISIBLE: <br> Make sure that what you write is appropriate for the public to read. Our pseudocode is visible to the public through the Devtools.<br><br>
        3. Decide on formatting rules for yourself and be consistent: <br>
          Eg. Writing all commands in CAPS. Consistent tense and language. <br><br>
        4. Use indentation: <br> Be intentnional about where you place your pseudocode and keep it organised. 
      </p>

      <h3 class ="plan-questions">The Rubber Ducky</h3>

        <p>
          Working through a problem in our heads can be a difficult task, and often this is because it can be hard to organise our thoughts in a effective manner. Talking through a problem to other people can be extremely helpful as we are more likely to lay out our throughts in a way that is eaier to follow. However, we may not always have people around to talk to when we are working, and it can also distract others from their own work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The rubber ducky method is a great solution for this, instead of explaining our challenge to a peer, explaining our problem outloud to ourselves or an innatimate object can help us get a different view point of our issue. Many times when we are explaining our problem to someone else, give ourselves a new view-point to analyse our problem that may guide us to the solution. 
        </p>

    <h3 class ="plan-questions">Error Messages</h3>
      
      <p>
        Error Messages are a fantastic resource for developers. Although they can be frustrating to see at first, but they give us insite into our situation and offer clues for us to use in solving our problem. 
      </p> 
      <h3>What to look our for:</h3>
      <p>
        KEYWORDS: <br>Words like undefined, type, function, body etc. can give us a clue of what specific elements in our code have a bug. <br><br>
        LOCATION: <br>Error messages also include sets of numbers that show us where in our code we can find these issues. <br>
        For example: (32:7) tells us that our error can before on line 32, starting on the 7th character.
      </p>

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors">
        Here is a link the MDN JavaScript error reference page
        </a>
       <P>
        This is a very useful site to refer to if you're stuggling to disipher your error messages. 
       </P>
       <!-- Spacer-->
       <div id="spacer"></div>


    <h3 class ="plan-questions">Console.log it before you move on!</h3>
      <p>
        It's better to check as you go with coding. So what better way to check if your code runs than by consoling it out. This prevents bugs slipping into our code and makes sure we are checking that our code is achieving what it's meant to.  
      </p>
        <!-- Spacer-->
        <div id="spacer"></div>

    <h3 class ="plan-questions">Google it!</h3>
      <p>
        We are so lucky to be in an industry, where teachers and mentors specialise in making websites! Resources like tech blogs and tutorials are often very accessible and user-friendly. Fortunately we do not have to memorise every small detail of code, and if we get stuck there is probably a blog post or W3 tutorial site that we can use as a guide to help us.
      </p>

    <h3 class ="plan-questions">Try it out</h3>
      <p>
        Code is creative and there is more than one way to solve a problem. So just have a go! Luckily we have git to back up our files so we can always undo any unwanted lines of code. It's important to give yourself time where you play around and just have fun with your code. 
      </p>

       <!-- Spacer-->
       <div id="spacer"></div>

      <h3 class ="plan-questions">Ask for help</h3>
       
       <p>
        It's hard to admit that we are unsure of something at any age, this is something that I have been feeling on my coding journey, coding is really hard and often when we are learning, the only way to be unstuck is with guidance and help from others. Luckily here at Devacademy, we have a discord stream full of peers and tutors that are happy to help. Other places to ask for help is with friends or online forums. Freecodecamp, Code Newbie and Scrimbra all have online communities and forums where you can post up problems and members of the community are happy to help. 
       </p>

       <h3>Important to remember:</h3>
       <p>
        The tech community relies on interaction and peer help, to keep this going we must also be open to helping others. At this stage of my coding journey, I do not yet have the knowledge of Javascript to help my peers but I am loking forward to learning more so I can give back and help others, just like others have helped me. 
       </p>

     <h3 class ="plan-questions">Improve with Reflection</h3>

       <p>
        Reflection is a critical part of the learning journey, offering our brain repeition of ideas gives this new knowledge more opportunity to remain in our memory. Reflection can also give us a new perspective on what have learnt as we can explore wider concepts and make connections of this knowledge with our prior knowledge which can help again in making sure this knowledge has a more permanent location in our brains
