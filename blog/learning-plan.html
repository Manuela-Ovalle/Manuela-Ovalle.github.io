  <h1>Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h1>

  <!-- Spacer-->
  <div id="spacer"></div>

  <p>
    My long term goal is to find a job position as a software engineer where I can capitalise on my strengths of character, be challenged intellectually and to grow as a person. 
  </p>

  <p>I would like this to be a job that gives my family financial security and gives me the opportunity to spend time with my whanau and performing as a musician. 
  </p>

<p>
  My short term goal is to gain an insight into HTML, CSS and JS through Devacademy and additional self-lead study. I hope to apply for a junior developer job next year. 
</p>
<p>
  While working as a front-end developer, I hope to study static and motion design in my own time and find ways to implement these skills into my career as a developer. 
</p>

 <div id="spacer"></div>

 <p>
  During foundations my strengths have been my curiosity, self-compassion, self-care and dedication to time-management growth. 
 </p>
 <p>
  I have been very consious in my efforts to maintain a healthy work-life balance, getting enough sleep, drinking sufficient water and spending time away from screens. I feel very proud of the improvements I've made in my time management in particular. I've followed my schedule with a lot of dedication and have been careful to plan my weekly schedule using the time boxes provided to ensure I am not rushing activities, and spending plenty of time on them to maximise my learning.
</p>

<p>
  My biggest limitation so far has been my limited coding confidence, I have had a tendency to overthink tasks and overcomplicate what the instructions are requiring.
</p>
<p>
 I get stressed and can feel overwhelmed in difficult situations, I want to continue practising reframing of stress in my mind. I've been doing some research into stress and finding out about how it is the body's natural response for challengning situations. We can use the adrenaline and energy that stress brings as a fuel. It's neither negative, nor positive but a response that we can learn to use to our advantage. In the past, feeling overwhelmed and stressed has left me a bit paralised and unaware of where to go next. I've been working on this by taking deep breaths and doing my best to break activities and methods down into small tasks. 
</p>

<p>
  Another limitation for me to be conscious of is my need to help others, even if it gets in the way of my own sucess. I have been making sure to communicate my change in schedule with my bandmates, friends, family and other people in my life so that they know tha I will be busy and less available for the time I am on bootcamp. I know that this will be a big challenge for me as I have a tendency to overcommit myself however, I have been doing my best to plan ahead of time and to communicate this to my husband who will be there to keep me accountable while I'm on bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
  My main non-technical challenges for bootcamp will be to work sustianably, to make the most of the energy stress gives me, to be patient with myself and others and finally, to make sure I am setting time aside to rest and recover. 
</p>

<p>
  Skills that I look forward to developing during bootcamp are communicating using professional language, self-advocacy and receving feedback. <br>

  I haven't worked in the tech sector before. I would like to learn how to communicate technical ideas in plain english terms so that non-technical clients can understand the strategy required for the project. 
</p>

<img class="blog-img" src="https://manuela-ovalle.github.io/blog/img/learning-plan/bootcamp-doodle.PNG" alt="Summary of my learning plan for bootcamp">

<p>
  My personal expectations for the bootcamp team include, ensuring we have enough time for whakawhanaungatanga so we can be comfortable engaging in korero about our jouneys and progress.
</p>
<p>
  I would also like to learn about what being a software enginer means in Aotearoa and learning about how we can uphold Te Tiriti o Waitangi in our professional and personal lives as techies. 
</p>
<p>
  My expectations are that the teaching during bootcamp will be scaffolded to ensure we can stand on our prior learning as we step into new knowledge. Alongside this expectation, is that the guidance we recieve pushes us to expand our knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
  I will show manaakitanga and whanaungatanga to my peers and kaiako. I will take ownership for my learning and be active in my search to make my learning effective for my learning needs. I will Practice ako (learner as teacher and teacher as learner) because learning through teaching is really effective for me.
</p>

<p>
My other commitments for bootcamp are:<br><br>

To work from 8:20am until 6:00pm on Monday to Friday with a lunch break and a coffee break. Giving myself occasional 30 second (look out the window) breaks to rest my eyes. <br><br>
To look after myself, I will make an effort to be active in the mornings before bootcamp so my body is prepared. <br><br>
Drink water and stay hydrated so my brain is able to focus
To practice meditation at least 3 times a week. <br><br>
To eat lunches that give me energy - I will maintain an awareness of foods that limits my productivity.

  <h2 class="plan-questions"> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  
  
  <p id="long-term-goals"> 
    <style>#long-term-goals {margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;
    }</style>
    3 year goal: <br><br>To work as a front-end developer in a position that integrates visual design as well as web development in my role. <br><br>
    5 year goal: <br><br>To expand my knowledge into motion design for websites and integrate that into my work as a developer / designer.</p> <br>

    <h2 class="plan-questions"> What are your learning strengths and limitations?</h2>
  
  <h3>Strengts</h3>
  <p>
    - Compassion and empathy: I am very focused on the emotions of people around me and making sure to communicate in a way that both parties understand. I make an effort to meet people and listen to them so I can get more of a sense of their view of the world to show that I am interested in understanding what they really mean and not just my interpretation of their words. I acknowledge that my perspective will of course always be influenced by my own lens of the world but I will try my best so we are on the same page as much as we can be.<br>
    - Creative thinking: I am constantly making connections between concepts that I learn and the prior knowledge I have. I’m inspired to explore connections between ideas that may not always be conventional and to use these woven connections to inform my problem solving in a creative manner.<br>
    - Resourcefulness: I am good at making the most of what I have. I think this will be particularly useful in coding because I know that it will be some time before I have a fluent understanding of code. In the mean time, I will be searching within my skills and knowledge to create the intended outcomes of a project the best that I can.<br>
    - Passion: I am a passionate learner and I put a lot of excitement and enthusiasm into what I do.</p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>

    <p>-I have spent many years building up my creative neuropathways, however I have not had as many learning opportunities to exercise my mathematical and logical thinking skills. It may take me some more time to grasp mathematical ideas. I’m also working hard to re-frame my relationship with mathematics, and right side of the brain thinking to make sure that I am confident in my skills and my ability to learn.<br>
      -Perfectionism: As many creatives are, I am often finding myself being nit picky about details. This can cause distraction and set backs for my time management.<br>
      -Burn out: In the past I’ve been prone to burn out due to my nit picky nature and over-excitement. To prevent this, I am actively pursuing healthy habits and the slow and steady approach to my work as opposed to the procrastinate and cram approach.

    <h2 class="plan-questions">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

    <p>
    -Project management: learning about co-ordinating projects and using systems that keep everyone in the loop of each other’s progress.<br>
    - Frustration tolerance and patience : as an emotional thinker, I want to continue working on distancing my emotions from certain areas of my work i.e: challenge and frustration. The advice of taking a breath and a short break in moments of challenge has been really helpful.<br>
    - Perseverance, similar to my prior point, I would like to continue to work on perseverance and I feel very confident that coding will be a big help.<br>
    -Self advocacy: as a young woman, I often feel intimidated by other people in the workplace. I would like to learn more about being confident in my own skills and knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2 class="plan-questions">How will you manage your workload for this programme?</h2>

    <p>
      I will manage my workload by working within a designated schedule for my studies. This will be 8:30am-6pm Mon-Fri and 9-11 on Sat for foundations (I will re-assess my timetable for bootcamp). This time will be strictly for my studies and if for some unexpected reason, I am unable to complete my intended work day when planned, I will make up for it in the weekend or the evenings.</p>

<p>When I begin to feel overwhelmed or that my work is building up, I will contact my peers or facilitators to seek the support needed for the situation. I have a few friends outside of the course within the tech industry who I have also spoken to regarding tutoring or help. I will make sure to seek guidance ahead of time.</p>

<p><b>Block out times:</b><br><br>

- 6-10pm Wednesday nights<br>
- Before 8am on weekdays<br>
- After 9:30pm weekdays<br>
