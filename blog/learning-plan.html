    <h2 class="plan-questions"> What are your learning strengths and limitations?</h2>
  
  <h3>Strengts</h3>
  <p>
    - Compassion and empathy: I am very focused on the emotions of people around me and making sure to communicate in a way that both parties understand. I make an effort to meet people and listen to them so I can get more of a sense of their view of the world to show that I am interested in understanding what they really mean and not just my interpretation of their words. I acknowledge that my perspective will of course always be influenced by my own lens of the world but I will try my best so we are on the same page as much as we can be.<br>
    - Creative thinking: I am constantly making connections between concepts that I learn and the prior knowledge I have. I’m inspired to explore connections between ideas that may not always be conventional and to use these woven connections to inform my problem solving in a creative manner.<br>
    - Resourcefulness: I am good at making the most of what I have. I think this will be particularly useful in coding because I know that it will be some time before I have a fluent understanding of code. In the mean time, I will be searching within my skills and knowledge to create the intended outcomes of a project the best that I can.<br>
    - Passion: I am a passionate learner and I put a lot of excitement and enthusiasm into what I do.</p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>

    <p>-I have spent many years building up my creative neuropathways, however I have not had as many learning opportunities to exercise my mathematical and logical thinking skills. It may take me some more time to grasp mathematical ideas. I’m also working hard to re-frame my relationship with mathematics, and right side of the brain thinking to make sure that I am confident in my skills and my ability to learn.<br>
      -Perfectionism: As many creatives are, I am often finding myself being nit picky about details. This can cause distraction and set backs for my time management.<br>
      -Burn out: In the past I’ve been prone to burn out due to my nit picky nature and over-excitement. To prevent this, I am actively pursuing healthy habits and the slow and steady approach to my work as opposed to the procrastinate and cram approach.

    <h2 class="plan-questions">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

    <p>
    -Project management: learning about co-ordinating projects and using systems that keep everyone in the loop of each other’s progress.<br>
    - Frustration tolerance and patience : as an emotional thinker, I want to continue working on distancing my emotions from certain areas of my work i.e: challenge and frustration. The advice of taking a breath and a short break in moments of challenge has been really helpful.<br>
    - Perseverance, similar to my prior point, I would like to continue to work on perseverance and I feel very confident that coding will be a big help.<br>
    -Self advocacy: as a young woman, I often feel intimidated by other people in the workplace. I would like to learn more about being confident in my own skills and knowledge.

    <h2 class="plan-questions">How will you manage your workload for this programme?</h2>

    <p>
      I will manage my workload by working within a designated schedule for my studies. This will be 8:30am-6pm Mon-Fri and 9-11 on Sat for foundations (I will re-assess my timetable for bootcamp). This time will be strictly for my studies and if for some unexpected reason, I am unable to complete my intended work day when planned, I will make up for it in the weekend or the evenings.</p>

<p>When I begin to feel overwhelmed or that my work is building up, I will contact my peers or facilitators to seek the support needed for the situation. I have a few friends outside of the course within the tech industry who I have also spoken to regarding tutoring or help. I will make sure to seek guidance ahead of time.</p>

<p><b>Block out times:</b><br><br>

- 6-10pm Wednesday nights<br>
- Before 8am on weekdays<br>
- After 9:30pm weekdays<br>
