  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  
  <p id="blog-intro">
    Emotional intelligence is defined using a range of attributes, however according to the resources that I found, a commonality is that EQ is a set of personal and interpersonal skills that encourages awareness and compassion to ones-self and others. These skills are necessary for collaboration and contributing to our society in a positive manner. What they may look like in a practical sense can differ largely depending on cultural norms and location. These skills are learnt throughout life and just like any others, require practice.</p><br>
    <b>Here is a list of common attributes for emotional intelligence:</b>
    <p>- Self-awareness<br>Recognise our own emotions and how they affect people around us. Also having an awareness of our strengths and limitations so we can make the most of those skills.
      -Self regulation and accountability<br>Being able to use our self-awareness to our advantage by managing our emotions effectively for the situation we are in. Self accountability encourages us to keep ourselves on task and focused on our work. 
      - Motivation<br>Finding motivation within ourselves and using positivity and resilience to continue through a challenging situation. 
      - Empathy<br>Prioritising getting to know people around us to make sure we can put ourselves in their shoes. Paying close attention to their reactions, body-language and the impact that our decisions have on them.  
      - Social Skills<br>Being open to talking to others and listening to what they have to say. Communicating in a way that considers the other person and their own form of communication, is the word choice appropriate? Is the conversation topic appropriate? Showing good social skills is working hard to find a middle ground of communication, adapting to others and having that reciprocated. </p>

    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>IQ refers to intellectual knowledge which considers problem solving, logic and reasoning, adapting to change, planning and the use of language. EQ is focused on relationships and engagement with our own selves and with others. Information associated with IQ is prioritised in traditional education, students are taught to read and write however, soft skills associated with EQ are more often expected to develop in the personal lives of students outside of the classroom. Personally, I believe that EQ skills require a lot of practice and thought, the opportunity to practice these skills in our personal lives is highly dependent on our relationships to whƒÅnanu and our community. However these relationships are unique and impacted by our circumstances. </p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>Someone can be highly intelligent in an IQ sense but be limited in their interpersonal skills, making them less effective in collaborative environments. Like I mentioned before, due to a lack of uniformity of EQ skill education, many people miss out on practising these skills and encounter repercussions in the workplace and in their every-day relationships. Limited social skills and empathy can make someone less agreeable. I have personally prioritised people who show strong EQ skills over IQ skills in the past when hiring potential employees. 
  We are all unique and have our own lens through which we view the world. Developing self-awareness and empathy can facilitate a more reciprocal and fair dynamic between parties. Listening to others effectively and making an effort to put ourselves in their shoes can help us change the inequity that occurs in society.
