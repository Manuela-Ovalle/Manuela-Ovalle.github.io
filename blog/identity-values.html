  <h3 class="plan-questions">What are achievements that you feel proud of?</h3>
    
  <p> Achievement is an interesting topic, I am facinated by what achievement can mean and its range of definitions. For me, I feel very proud of traditional accomplishments like my tertiary education, I have a bachelors of music performance and a post graduate diploma in secondary teaching. However I also feel a great sense of accomplishment in my actions to reduce my carbon-footprint and live a more sustainable life-style. I have been self-sufficent in herbs and tomatoes all year!</p>

<h3 class="plan-questions">Where do your values come from?</h3>
<p>I think a lot of my values stem from my hardworking parents who made big sacrifices to move our family to New Zealand from Colombia during a time of political and economic instability for my homeland. My parents have always valued creativity and due to coming from a lower-socio economic background I’ve been raised as a resourceful problem solver. If we couldn’t afford particular things we needed, my parents would find alternatives through DIY or collaboration etc and this is a mindset that I was brought up with. My parents taught me that willingness and creativity are significant forms of wealth. </p>
  <p>An example of this is the furniture of my childhood home, which my father handcrafted. He had to go out and search for free wood that people would throw out and he would transform it into long-lasting, beautiful pieces of furniture. He would investigate the skills and techniques needed to craft and then apply them for the benefit of his situation. </p>
  
  <p>I’ve always been a person of hobbies and interests, constantly obsessing over new skills and dedicating as much time as I can to push my knowledge to new places. It started off with arts and crafts then music, and has gradually focused more on design, illustration and visual forms of communication and media. My interest in design came out of a budget issue when organising my mum's wedding, we didn’t have a budget for fancy wedding invitations so I decided I would try my best to study a free program (similar to photoshop) and design my own. Quickly, I fell in love with this program and in my own time outside of my music degree and teaching diploma I’ve been teaching myself design, illustration and video editing skills to accompany all the promotion involved in my musical life. I often find myself learning new skills out of necessity and developing a passion for these skills.</p>

  <p>Last year I studied for a post graduate diploma of teaching, it was a fantastic place for me to use my compassion, patience and organisation skills which are some of my biggest strengths of character, however I craved the time for creativity and problem solving. I feel that being a developer will be a role where I will thrive and make the most of my range of skills, helping others, thinking creatively and constantly pushing myself to learn new skills through problem solving. </p>

<h3 class="plan-questions">whakatauki that sum up some of your values:</h3>
<p><b>Ahakia he iti he pounamu</b><br>
Although it is small, it is of value - A tiny seed can grow into a massive tree, I am small and I am often told I have a big voice! I love this whakatauki and I want it to guide my coding Kaupapa. My coding knowledge is small and full of enthusiasm. If I nurture it, water it every day and stay consistent, it can grow as big as kauri trees in the Tāne Mahuta forest. <br>

<b>Ko te manu e kai ana i te miro nōnā te ngahere, Ko te manu e kai ana i te mātauranga nōnā te ao.</b><br>
The bird that consumes the miro berry owns the forest, the bird that consumes knowledge owns the world. 
I love this whakatauki as well, it aligns with my value of communication and knowledge. (It also has my name Manu in it) During my time at teacher’s college, I was really confronted by the idea that conflicts and disagreements, more often than not, stem out of mis-communication or  mis-interpretation as opposed to mal-intent. <br>
After spending time with this thought I recalled moments in my life when this was applicable, when I felt rejected or discriminated against, but looking retrospectively, I could see that this was often due to a misunderstanding or mis-interpretation of ideas. Now I am working hard to both learn as much about the world as I can, and as much about the people I spend time with too. Listening in and understanding different viewpoints has been very helpful particularly in group situations. I hope that the more I learn about other cultures and other people, the kinder, more compassionate I become. </p>

<h3 class="plan-questions">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>

<p>When I was 18 years old, I regularly attended the same church, which I had been brought up in. I volunteered in the music team for many years and I was heavily involved in activities for youth.  One day at youth group there was a particularly racist message where the speakers used illegal migration of Mexicans into USA as a metaphor for leaving life as a sinner and crossing over to jesus. Being Latin American myself and going through a journey in my visual art practice where I explored the colonisation of the Latin American continent, this church message cut me deeply. Half way through, I stood up and I left. I was overcome with emotions due to the ironic situation I was in.The tagline of the church’s mission that season was “being a home to belong in” However, I had never felt more unwelcome. My first action was to step away from the situation and give myself time to cool down. <br>
  Luckily for myself, I felt the courage to talk with the youth pastor about the message. As politely as I could, I expressed the pain and disappointment I felt. I was honest and felt that the best way to communicate was to be open about my feelings, listen to the other person and try my best to make sure my emotions did not get the best of me. I felt shocked that somehow this message had been approved and shared to a very large congregation of youth. With no regards to the explicit racism being used. I went on to speak to several other leaders of the church who apologised and expressed remorse. It was important to me to discuss the situation with other people and to make sure I could listen to multiple opinions. <br>
  Despite this being an uncomfortable situation where I stood up alone and spoke out  to authoritative figures on my own as a young woman. I feel grateful that I opened my eyes to realise that my surroundings at that time were not with like-minded people. I realised in that moment that I could express my feelings, my concerns and remain as calm as I needed to be. What is important to me, is that I am true to myself and my beliefs of peace, compassion and respect. This is a moment where I was able to communicate effectively, to feel the pain in a situation and to finally make a decision that suited me. I feel proud of my actions, I feel proud that I was one of 2 latin americans in the room in a group of around 300 youth but I still felt the need to stand up for my people and to stand up to racism even if I was alone. </p>

<h3 class="plan-questions">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
<p>
  My cultural identity plays a very big role in my life, and my own view of self. Like many immigrants, I felt like an alien for a long time, not latina enough, not kiwi enough, but through growth, knowledge and conversation I have been able to recognise that my identity is both. I am not one or the other, I am both. My creativity has allowed me to explore this in my music and to find satisfaction in a dual cultural identity. <br>
Coming from a country with a background of colonisation and intergenerational trauma, I am able to align the experiences and stories of my whenua with those of Tanagata Whenua. In my teaching practice and in my life in general, I am passionate about enacting equity and being aware of my privileges and the benefits that I have because of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Compassion and empathy are my strengths of character and they allow me to not understand, because I am not Māori, but to feel responsibility for ensuring equity for Māori and to embed Te Ao and matauranga māori into my life. Aotearoa is my home and I am committed as an ally in this movement towards a bi-cultural Aotearoa.

<h3 class="plan-questions">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
<p>
  My strengths are curiosity, creativity and compassion. My curiosity will support me by maintaining excitement and wonder in the projects. I see coding as a superpower and a limitless way to create new things and explore my creativity. I will also use my creative thinking when reassessing a challenge and viewing it from a different point of view. Lastly, my compassion will enable me to work with kindness and consideration for my peers. The compassion that I feel encourages me to consider the purpose and outcome of the projects I work on and how the users will interact with them. Afterall, programmers don’t make apps and programs only for computers, they make them for people to use.

<h3 class="plan-questions">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
<p>
  I am a very emotional thinker, I am often led astray by a feeling and this can affect my time management. I am aware that there isn’t always time for exploration and additional trials so I will have to make sure that I compensate for this with planned timelines and schedules. I can be very organised if I find an organisation system that works with the task at hand. At the moment I am using an app called Notion to store my notes and ideas. I'm finding it easy to navigate and it is built almost like a blog with easy to access databases. <br>
  I can be indecisive when it comes to small decisions and an overthinker as well. This is particularly when it comes to aesthetic decisions. So far I am finding that a solid plan ahead of time with particular guidelines like colour pallets and time frames help me stay on track and make my decisions faster.

<h3 class="plan-questions">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
<p>
  I am in a band of 9 people and in the past I have been experimenting with different project management apps and tools to keep our goals and intentions laid out in front of us. Managing the band is a big task and so far a significant setback for us has been a lack of communication and a need for more accessible planning. <br>
One of the former members of the band would offer resistance to changes that myself and other members would suggest for new projects. This resistance looked like being absent to meetings, not replying to messages and not meeting deadlines. Unfortunately he wouldn’t contribute solutions to the issues we had, these were particularly with finishing projects. One of the main strategies that I have been using is to have clear communication with my team members and finding kind but direct ways to bring up difficult topics in conversation. It’s been a good opportunity to learn about de-escalating situations and ensuring that my word choice is appropriate for the situation. I am learning in my journey that it is better to be upfront and honest about an issue before it escalates and becomes a big problem. <br>
Another strategy is planning in an accessible manner. What I mean by accessibility is that the systems that we use must make sense to my band members and are not too difficult to contribute to. In my opinion, this is very challenging due to the limited tech skills of some members. The main form of communication is face to face discussion, we have more meetings during our rehearsals as this seems to be the most effective way. We keep notes of our discussions and when we plan ahead we take consideration of the discussions of the team. <br>
Finally I think that a positive attitude and a strong contribution from myself has played a big role in an uplift in morale and contribution overall from my bandmates. We were held back by covid significantly in our plans to release music and perform. Many of us were disillusioned but after our first show back, I was able to spark up my flame of motivation and begin to piece together a game plan that suited us, our budgets and our members as individuals. 
Now, I am making sure to continue using all of the aforementioned strategies as well as being honest and recognising the ability for growth and maintaining a growth mindset. My band members and I do not have much experience in managing a music group, being honest about where we are at and maintaining an open-ness for discussion and advice has been and will continue to be incredibly enriching.
