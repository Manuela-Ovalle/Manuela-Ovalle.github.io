  <h3>What is neuroplasticity? </h3>
  
  <p id="blog-intro">
    Having an awareness of the potential of the human brain encourages us to step away from limitations and boundaries that we can create for ourselves in our minds. Often we become attached to comments said by others about the way we and we use these words to dictate the way we see our abilities. </p>

    <p>However science tells us that no matter how old you are or how much prior knowledge you have, there’s always room for growth. It takes work and consistency to keep our brains plastic and active.</p>
   
    <h3>Neuroplasticity principles </h3>

    <img src="https://manuela-ovalle.github.io/blog/img/neuroplasticity/neuro-principles-28.jpg" alt="sketch notes illustrations of the neuroplasticity principles" class="blog-img">

    <p>
      I like the principle of use it and improve it, I think taking new knowledge and making connections to prior knowledge and making it relevant to our own lives is a fantastic way to absorb information. Although coding is brand new to me, thinking about associations and analogies allow me to take something new and make it more familiar. <br>

Knowing the importance of the work you engage in and seeing a link to goals and challenges keeps us focused and motivated, particularly in times of stress. Finally, repetition, repetition, repetition, coming from a teaching background, I recognise and value repetition and exposure to new ideas. While concepts may seem inaccessible and impossible at first, the more we engage with content, the more opportunities we have to view that content from different angles and get to become familiar with it.
    </p>

    <p>Finding joy in lifelong learning keeps our neural pathways active and strong. To increase neuroplasticity we need to engage in new learning and put ourselves in challenging situations that push ourselves out of our intellectual comfort zones. <br>

    DrAndrew Huberman a neuro scientist put together a list which he named t “Neuro Plasticity super-protocol. This list has 9 practical steps to working on neuroplasticity and maintaining focus when learning. It’s great how applicable these skills are.</p>

  <h1 id="Growthm-header"> Growth mindset</h1>
  <h3>What is Growth Mindset? </h3>

  <p>
    Growth mind set is an attitude that we can adopt in order to keep our brains plastic and active while neuropasticity is more focused on the anatomical capacity of the brain, growth mindset is more like self-belief. If we decide that we aren’t good at a task or skill, we are less likely to engage in that learning.  As humans we create associations in our brains about particular knowledge or careers, eg. coding is for super smart people; however we need to remember that we are only limited by our own mental limitations. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve been aware of the concept of growth mindset for a while and I’ve been working hard to adopt this mindset into my perspective on my coding journey. My career path so far has been quite different to coding and I am constantly working on reminding myself that I am not dumb, I am a developer in progress. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I am surprised by how much of a fixed mindset I have had in my life, it’s a big challenge for me to break these habits and when I am frustrated with my coding work, fixed mindset ideas come bubbling up to the surface. Using the word ‘yet’ has been really helpful, any tme I have negative self talk, I just say the word yet at the end of my sentence, and it keeps me viewing my perspective in a more encouraging light. 
<br>
“I’m not good at Javascript……. YET!”

<br> 
I am a big fan of a podcast called the Happiness Lab. there is a very informative talk about growth mindset.

<p>Moving forward, to continue on my growth mindset journey I would lke to write a "Not Yet" list that I can use to inform my learning goals for devacademy.</p>
