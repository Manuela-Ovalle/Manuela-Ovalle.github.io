    <h2 id="relationship-js-html-css-heading" class="plan-questions">How do HTML, CSS and Javascript work go together?</h2>

    <p id="relationship-intro">Javascript is a tool that allows a web developer the ability to take a static website and make it dynamic and interactive. As I was thinking of an analogy to illustrate this I thought of directions and maps as a way to illustrate the relationship between HTML, CSS and JS (javascript) in the process of building an app.</p>

    <h3>HTML is like having a step by step list of instructions for a guide: </h3>
   


<p>
      - Go to the front door of the house <br>
      - drive to the 200m to the end of Apple street and turn right onto Kale lane<br>
      - drive 50m on Kale lane and turn right onto Avo avenue<br>
      - drive 120m on Avo ave and turn left onto Cherry Street<br>
      - drive to the end of Pizza road (130m) and turn left on Pineapple place<br>
      - drive 50m down pineapple place and turn right onto Cheese ave<br>
      - drive for 220m down Cheese ave and you’ve reached your destination!<br>

      <p>Now we can see what the journey will look like but our map is static.</p>

<h3>JAVASCRIPT takes our map a step further</h3>
<p>Our guide is not static anymore, now it’s like using google maps. Instead of having one journey that we must follow (hard code) google maps allows us to go a different route to reach our journey, if we need to. Javascript gives us the ability to make changes to our HTML elements both manually but also with code that reacts to the actions of a user. If I take a wrong turn, the map allows for an alternate route. </p>

 <div id="flow-and-loops">
  <h2 id="control-flow-and-loops-heading" class="plan-questions">What is control flow in Javascript?</h2>
<p>Control flow is the direction that a computer follows when running code. Just like when we read English, the computer starts from left to right and from top to bottom.  <br>

  In JavaScript we can use loops, conditionals and functions to change this order. To continue on my previous association of reading English, one could compare the change in flow to reading a newspaper spread, the reader’s gaze may not necessarily read from top to bottom but instead scan the headlines and bounce around the page.

<div id="the-dom">
 <h2 id="the-dom-heading" class="plan-questions">What is The Dom and how do we interact with it?</h2>
 <p>
  The DOM, (document object model) is a tool that allows a developer to view code in several ways directly on the browser. This tool displays the html document as the nodes and objects allowing us to use javascript to interact with the page. One way that we can interact with the document is using the console.log command to run and debug the code. We can also use the querySelector command to select specific elements and manipulate them using other commands such as eventListener allow us to have popups or changes when a user of the site clicks or hovers over those elements.

  <div id="arrays-and-objects">
    <h2 id="arrays-and-objects-heading" class="plan-questions">What are arrays and objects? How do we access data frm them?</h2>
    <p>
      An array is a collection of data that is displayed using square brackets []. This collection is referred to as an index and each piece of data is numbered allowing the programmer to select and use individual pieces of data by referencing the index position of that chosen piece of data.  We begin counting index positions with the number 0 not the number 1. So for example, in an array of 4 pieces of data the index positions would be [0,1,2,3]. </p>
        <!-- Spacer-->
        <div id="spacer"></div>
        <!-- footer-->
      <h3>Here is an example of what an array could look like:</h3> 
      <br>
      <p>
              let shoes = [nike, Adidas, vans, new balance]<br>
      <br>
          index positions =[0    , 1   , 2   , 3      ]<br></p>
          <br>
      <h3>Here I will choose vans which have the 2 index position.</h3><br>
      
      let shoe = shoes[2];
    </p>
    <p>
      The word object in javascript describes a standalone entity with its own properties and type. We can think of objects in code the way we think of objects in real life. Declaring objects is useful because we can assign particular properties of that object for example, if our object is a coffee, we can give it a price, a stock amount, the cost of making the coffee and so on. </p>

      <h3>Lets declare an object:</h3>
      
      <p>const cactus =  { <br>
        <br>
      type: ‘San Pedro’<br>
      <br>
      height: ‘6 meters’<br>
      <br>
      location: ‘Auckland Botanic Gardens’<br>
      
      }</p>

  <div id="functions">
    <h2 id="functions-heading" class="plan-questions">What are functions and why are they useful?</h2>
    <p>
      Functions in Javascript are a set of instructions that we want our computer to run. These can be written out once (declared) and we can ask the computer to execute these instructions again and again by calling the function name.<br>

      Below is an example of a function named ‘greet’. This function will console log the userName and greeting every time we call the function. Functions are useful because once they have been declared, we don’t have to type out the whole set of instructions, we only need to call its name.</p>
